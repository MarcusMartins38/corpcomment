## What is the project about?

Corp Comment is a React-based application designed to allow users to submit and retrieve comments from an external server. Users can filter the retrieved comments by company names using hashtags (e.g., #companyName) found within the text.

## Why did you develop it, what was your motivation?

The primary motivation behind developing Corp Comment was to enhance my understanding of React fundamentals with TypeScript. This project provided an opportunity to implement the Context API, explore its limitations, and learn how Zustand can offer significant benefits. Additionally, it allowed me to practice creating custom hooks, enhancing the reusability and manageability of the code.

## Key Features

- **Submit Comments**: Users can text and submit any comment.
- **Fetch Comments**: The app fetches comments from an external server.
- **Display Comments**: Retrieved comments are displayed in the app.
- **Filter by Company**: Users can filter comments by company names using hashtags (e.g., #companyName).

## What have you learned?

Through the development of Corp Comment, I have:

- Gained a deeper understanding of React fundamentals with TypeScript.
- Implemented the Context API and explored its limitations.
- Learned how to use Zustand for state management and its benefits over Context API.
- Practiced creating custom hooks to enhance code reusability and manageability.

## What makes your project stand out?

Corp Comment stands out due to its practical utility and the effective use of modern React and TypeScript practices. The integration of Zustand for state management showcases a robust solution to common challenges faced with the Context API. Additionally, the ability to filter comments by company names adds a layer of functionality that can be particularly valuable in corporate settings.
